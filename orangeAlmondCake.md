Orange and almond cake is a very moist, nutty and a very orangy cake. It is a cake that I feel should be in every cooks repertoire. If you haven’t yet come across this famous cake till now you’re in for a real treat.

Egyptian born Claudia Roden first brought this orange and almond cake to light in her 1968 cookbook, 'Book of Middle Eastern Food'. This cake was originally created for passover, hence it uses of almond meal(flour) instead of wheat flour.
